M-1 — PLANNING. Branch feat/m0-planning. 2026-09-19.

Delivered: the project brief (`.plans/2026-09-19-chez-http-server-project-brief.md`), the async-model options paper, the test corpus survey, decisions 0001–0008, this ledger. Evidence under `.plans/research/`: 61 agent reports (7 corpus finders, 28 skeptic batches, 6 async proposals, 3 judges, 8 reference-server reads, 4 gap analyses with 4 refuters), the live control-flow spike (`research/spike/`, every experiment run twice), and the two structured results (`corpus-final.json`, `track2-final.json`).

Decisions taken by the owner on 2026-09-19: strictly serial pipelining with read-stop (0004); nginx-style bounded defaults (0005); HTTP/1.0 supported, h2c answered 505, one upgrade hand-off hook (0006); upstream asks filed as issues and tackled first (0008).

Upstream issues filed 2026-09-19 (verified against source before filing): chez-httparse #32 #33 #34 #35 #36; chez-libuv #18 #19 #20 #21; uriparse #9 #10 #11; later that day chez-httparse #42 (split from #33) and uriparse #18 (follow-up to #11).

Measured environment: Darwin arm64, Chez 10.4.1 threaded (`tarm64osx`), libuv 1.52.1 (Homebrew pkg-config), CMake 4.3.3, Node v20.10.0, 8 CPUs. Baseline: the repository has no `Makefile` and no tests yet; `chez-libuv`'s shim is built and `(import (libuv))` resolves; `(generated httparse-message)` loads from the chez-httparse checkout.

Not done: the completeness critic over the research (deferred to save credits; its questions are folded into the brief's standing risks). Raw agent reports are untracked; the owner decides at the merge gate which of `.plans/research/` is committed (recommended: `spike/`, the two JSON results, this README, and the curated docs; the raw `*.md` reports optional).

UPSTREAM LANDED (2026-09-19, later): chez-httparse #32 and #35 closed on `main` (cdf51d9 methods, f878068 decisions; no tag yet); uriparse #9 and #10 closed in the v0.2.0 release (M3 charset, M4 host grammar, M9 authority-form). Local checkouts verified in sync with origin (behind 0, ahead 0, clean).

Smoke evidence, one program importing `(httparse decisions) (httparse methods) (uri collect) (uri components)` (scratchpad `smoke-upstream.sps`, run on Darwin arm64, Chez 10.4.1; exit 0):

    keep-alive quadrants (expect #f #t #t #f #t #f): #f #t #t #f #t #f
    needs-eof (expect #f #t #f #f #f): #f #t #f #f #f
    flags: 1 2 64 512
    methods: GET CONNECT 5 2
    authority-form lenient: (ok example.com:443) (err not-authority-form 15)
    authority-form strict: ok (err userinfo-forbidden 1) (err port-required 12) ok
    validate host with CR (expect err): (err invalid-reg-name 10)
    validate host with SP (expect err): (err invalid-reg-name 10)
    validate clean (expect ok): ok

The quadrant row is the literal `http.c:157` gate (1.2 keeps alive without a header, 2.0 does not); the `[::1]:8443` row is the bracket-aware split. Decision 0008's table, the brief's "Upstream first" and M0/M2 text, decision 0001's layout note and the pins above were updated to match.

UPSTREAM LANDED (2026-09-19, later still): chez-libuv #18 closed on `main` at 529ea57 (PR #22), untagged. `make build` in the checkout found the shim current. Smoke evidence (scratchpad `smoke-writev.sps`, loopback on one loop, Darwin arm64, Chez 10.4.1, libuv 1.52.1; exit 0):

    empty-list refusal: (refused uv-write*! empty-segment-list)
    on-complete err: none
    completions (expect 1): 1
    bytes match concatenation (expect match): match
    received: HTTP/1.1 200 OK / Content-Length: 5 / (blank) / helloTRAILER

Three segments — a header bytevector, the span [2,7) of "xxhelloyy", a trailer bytevector — arrived as one ordered stream with exactly one completion. M3's serializer therefore emits segments, not a concatenated head.

UPSTREAM PLANNED / LANDED (2026-09-19, evening): chez-libuv #21 closed on `main` at 83e0184 (PR #23: `uv-tcp-keepalive!`, reuseport bind flag; post-v0.1, pin unchanged at 529ea57). chez-libuv #19 and #20 answered: planned as Stage 1 (`uv_run` and all 13 trampolines `__collect_safe`, ships alone) and Stage 2 (`uv_async` as a 14th trampoline, enforced per-loop thread affinity with `&uv-wrong-thread`) of one arc; spike, design and plan sit on chez-libuv's local branch `spike/threading-collect-safe` (23fa923, not pushed). Their T2b contradicted E5c's "92 ms with a 1 ms poll". Reconciled with three new spike programs, each run twice (`research/spike/e5d-ticker-needs-trap-ticks.sps`, `e5e-gc-stall-uvrun-default.sps`, `e5f-collect-safe-callback-cost.sps`; Darwin arm64, Chez 10.4.1 threaded, libuv 1.52.1; exit 0):

    E5d  loop-thread Scheme per 1 ms tick -> worker alloc load, plain uv_run: 0 calls 439-447 ms | 100 calls 82-85 | 300 calls 29-32 | 1000+ calls 9-20 | uncontended mutex 437-438 | (sleep 0) 9-12 | __collect_safe 6-10
    E5e  through the binding, one (uv-run loop 'default): 1 ms timer 44-92 ms | 300 ms timer 10223-10240 ms | E5c baseline 26-29 ms
    E5f  per callback, 256 idle handles, 5,000,000 callbacks x 3: plain 177-192 ns | __collect_safe 235-249 ns

Reading: Chez services another thread's collect request only at `$event`, and firing the collector does not shorten the 1000-tick trap budget (Chez 10.4.1 c/schsig.c:574-594, s/cmacros.ss:2118, s/library.ss:1219-1236). The 1 ms timer is not a workaround; chez-libuv's D2 (do not ship it) stands and our #19 proposal is withdrawn in a comment posted on #19. Corrected: options paper (E5c row, new E5d-E5f rows, threads row, numbers table), spike report (E5c reading, conclusion 6, new conclusion 8, new E5d-E5f sections), brief (risk line, upstream paragraph), ADR-0003 (reopening condition), ADR-0008 (#19/#20/#21 rows, dated consequence), global-constraints (pin note), research README.

UPSTREAM LANDED (2026-09-19, night): chez-httparse v0.3.0 (734d6ce: #32, #35) and v0.4.0 (1cddba8: #33 via PR #41, #34 via PR #43 as docs, #36 via PR #44 as docs, #42 via PR #45) are tagged; all six chez-httparse issues closed. #42 was split out of #33 at our review of that fix and landed the same evening with the "uniform" answer we posted (issue 42, comment 5746115452). Local checkout at 1cddba8, in sync, byte-machine submodule at v0.6.0. Upstream conformance unchanged at 274 of 274; the generated parser is no longer byte-identical to v0.3.0 (one node added, one error-table entry renamed), generated-runtime ABI still 9. All smoke programs now live in `research/spike/smoke-*.sps`. Evidence, Darwin arm64, Chez 10.4.1, `chez --libdirs <httparse>/src:<httparse>/vendor/byte-machine/src --program`, exit 0 for each:

`smoke-finish-42.sps` (#42): the two llhttp `request/finish.md` `finish=2` inputs plus mid-header-field, mid-method and mid-body, then five feed-only URL probes showing nothing reaches the eof declaration from a feed:

    --- parser-finish! from an UNSAFE state
    (D mid-header-field  GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHos             feed need-input finish-field 2 finish error (invalid-eof-state Invalid EOF state))
    (E finish.md#2 mid-header-value (finish=2)           feed need-input finish-field 2 finish error (invalid-eof-state Invalid EOF state))
    (F finish.md#3 mid-header-field (finish=2)           feed need-input finish-field 2 finish error (invalid-eof-state Invalid EOF state))
    (G mid-method  GE                                    feed need-input finish-field 2 finish error (invalid-eof-state Invalid EOF state))
    (H mid-body    PUT / HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Length: 5\r\n\r\nab feed need-input finish-field 2 finish error (invalid-eof-state Invalid EOF state))
    --- feed only: can the URL sub-machine answer unexpected-eof without a finish?
    (U1 GET http HTTP/1.1      feed error at 9 (invalid-url Invalid characters in url))
    (U2 GET http:/ HTTP/1.1    feed error at 10 (invalid-url Unexpected char in url schema))
    (U3 GET http:// HTTP/1.1   feed need-input at 24 -)
    (U4 GET http://h@ HTTP/1.1 feed need-input at 26 -)
    (U5 GET http://h: HTTP/1.1 feed need-input at 26 -)

`smoke-finish.sps` (#33; the same four situations probed on v0.2.0 before filing, where row A counted 0 completions):

    (A close-delimited response body: feed need-input finish finished finish-field 1 message-complete-count 1)
    (B idle parser, no input at all:   feed need-input finish finished finish-field 0 message-complete-count 0)
    (C complete request then EOF:      feed need-input finish finished finish-field 0 message-complete-count 1)
    (D EOF mid-header (unsafe):        feed need-input finish error finish-field 2 message-complete-count 0)

`smoke-v040.sps` (#36 and #34, using `docs/api.org`'s own `transfer-encoding-error->status` and `result-hands-off-stream?` verbatim; the last row's tail is `GET /b HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n`, printed literally):

    --- #36: invalid-transfer-encoding split by parser-error-node-name (llhttp transfer-encoding.md inputs)
    (pigeons         error invalid-transfer-encoding Request has invalid `Transfer-Encoding` node e-request-invalid-te status 501)
    (chunkedchunked  error invalid-transfer-encoding Request has invalid `Transfer-Encoding` node e-request-invalid-te status 501)
    (chunked,deflate error invalid-transfer-encoding Invalid `Transfer-Encoding` header value node e-bad-te-value status 400)
    (empty TE + CL   error invalid-transfer-encoding Empty Transfer-Encoding node e-empty-transfer-encoding status 400)
    --- #34: the two hand-off channels and parser-result-next
    (CONNECT  paused pause (paused-upgrade Pause on CONNECT/Upgrade) error #f consumed 55 next 55 tail TUNNEL hands-off? #t)
    (Upgrade  paused pause (paused-upgrade Pause on CONNECT/Upgrade) error #f consumed 63 next 63 tail WSDATA hands-off? #t)
    (h2c PRI  error pause #f error (paused-h2-upgrade Pause on PRI/Upgrade) consumed 24 next 24 tail FRAME hands-off? #t)
    (plain pause at on-message-complete (pipelining) paused pause #f error #f consumed 19 next 19 tail GET /b HTTP/1.1<CRLFCRLF> hands-off? #f)

`smoke-upstream.sps` (regression of v0.3.0's decisions/methods and uriparse v0.2.0): output identical to the block above.

Reading: (1) M6 and the test client treat `'finished` from a close-delimited finish as completion because the callback now fires; (2) the server core acts on the finish status alone on peer EOF, so `invalid-eof-state` is documentation for the test client, not a branch in the core; (3) M5's status mapping splits `invalid-transfer-encoding` by `parser-error-node-name`, never by reason string; (4) M2/M6/M8 recognise a hand-off with the doc's two-channel check and hand the tail from `parser-result-next` onward, and a pipelining pause carries no pause reason, which is how the core tells the two apart. Updated: decision 0008 (rows #32–#36, new #42 row, dated consequence), decision 0006 (channel note), the brief ("Upstream first", risks 3 and 4, settled item 7), global-constraints (pin), memory.

UPSTREAM LANDED (2026-09-19, later that night): uriparse v0.3.0 is tagged (7fe6688, 20:30 -0400; its CHANGELOG dates the release 2026-09-20, UTC). #11 closed via PR #15 (a1b9176): `uri-collector-reset! : Collector -> unspecified` on `(uri collect)` returns a collector to its just-constructed state in place (byte-machine's `parser-reset!` with the embedder-chosen mode kept; the span table, the offset table and the verdict flags cleared; nothing reallocated), so a server holds one collector per connection instead of allocating a parser and two `eq-hashtable`s per request-target; `uri-parse` is unchanged (its decision 0029). The release also states uriparse's first conformance claim, scoped: `uri-parse-validate` is audited recognizer-equivalent to RFC 3986 Appendix A per mode (an independent whole-URI oracle read from the ABNF, an exhaustive length-0..5 sweep over a 12-byte alphabet in all three modes, the normative corpora and 213 adversarial vectors, zero deviations; recognition only, not error code or offset; `uri-parse` stays lenient by design; its decisions 0028, 0030, 0031). All three uriparse issues are closed; the pin moves from v0.2.0 to the v0.3.0 tag. Local checkout verified: `main` at 69d2a84 is the tag plus its ledger close-out, `src/` byte-identical to the tag, in sync with origin (behind 0, ahead 0, clean); vendor byte-machine at 0245db3 (v0.6.0), the commit chez-httparse vendors too.

`smoke-uriparse-v030.sps` (#11; run twice under gtimeout on Darwin arm64, Chez 10.4.1 `tarm64osx`, `chez --libdirs ~/github/uriparse/src:~/github/uriparse/vendor/byte-machine/src --program`; both runs exit 0 and agree to the line except the last reuse row, 505 vs 500 ns):

    --- #11: reset-and-reparse equals a fresh collector (components and offsets; expect #t in every row)
    (uri http://a/b?q#f -> http://h/x reuse==fresh #t offsets (0 7 8 #f #f))
    (uri http:/p -> http://a/x reuse==fresh #t offsets (0 7 8 #f #f))
    (uri-reference g/h -> /p reuse==fresh #t offsets (#f #f 0 #f #f))
    (uri-reference g:h -> a/b reuse==fresh #t offsets (#f #f 0 #f #f))

    --- one 'uri-reference target of 46 bytes, 200000 parses per pass, fresh collector vs one reset collector
    fresh: per-parse-bytes 3680 ns 1210

    fresh: per-parse-bytes 3680 ns 1205
    reuse: per-parse-bytes 1584 ns 505
    fresh/reuse bytes ratio: 2 time ratio x10: 24
    done

Reading: (1) The reset is byte-identical to a fresh parse across the rooted and verdict transitions and after an error result, so a reused collector needs no reuse-specific branch in the core. But it reaches only the streaming interface: `uri-parse-validate` is `uri-parse` on a fresh collector followed by `validate-result`, which walks the components leftmost-first, rebases each validator's index through the offset seam, and is not exported (collect.sls:249-263, 271-275); `uri-parse-authority-form-validate` parses a spliced copy through `uri-parse` the same way (collect.sls:370). M2 validates origin-form and absolute-form through `uri-parse-validate` and CONNECT through the authority-form validator, so on the validated path the "accept the allocation" workaround stands for v1 and #11's win waits until uriparse exports validation over a parse result (`uri-parse-result-validate : uri-parse-result -> uri-parse-result`, additive, the existing procedure). `(uri charset)`'s `validate-component` and `(uri host)`'s `validate-authority` are exported, but composing them in the server would copy the audited recognizer rather than call it. Filed as uriparse #18 (https://github.com/Kiyomi-Computation-Systems/uriparse/issues/18). (2) Measured once, not a lane (uriparse's decision 0016 applies here too): on a 46-byte origin-form target the fixed per-call cost was 2096 bytes and about 0.7 µs of a 3680-byte, 1.2 µs parse; what remains is the result and its copied components, which the collector allocates by design. uriparse's own one-shot figure is ~6.4x on a shorter target, ours 2.4x on this one; both are evidence, not gates. (3) M2's request-target validation cites an audited oracle: `uri-parse-validate` accepts exactly what RFC 3986 Appendix A accepts, per mode, so the server's request-target tests cover only what HTTP adds on top (the RFC 9112 §3.2 forms, decision 0005's byte limits) and never re-derive the URI grammar. `smoke-upstream.sps` re-run against chez-httparse v0.4.0 and uriparse v0.3.0: output identical to its block above (nine rows, exit 0). Updated: decision 0008 (row #11, the night bullet's count, a dated consequence), the brief (dependencies line, settled item 7, "Upstream first"), global-constraints (pin), research/README, memory.

Still open upstream: chez-libuv #19 #20 (both planned upstream); uriparse #18 (validation over a parse result, the follow-up to #11; optimisation).

NEXT: nothing is open upstream on the v1 path; the one optimisation left (validating a reused collector's result) is filed as uriparse #18. M0 can start on branch `feat/m0-skeleton`, pinning chez-httparse at the v0.4.0 tag, uriparse at the v0.3.0 tag and chez-libuv at 529ea57 until v0.6.0 is tagged.
