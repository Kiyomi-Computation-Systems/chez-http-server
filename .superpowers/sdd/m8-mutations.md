# M8 — mutation log

Every test in M8 is watched to fail: a single named mutation breaks the
asserted property, the suite goes red, and the mutation is reverted. Recorded
per global-constraints ("a test is finished when it has been watched to fail").
The milestone plan §14 names the slice's mutations; the extras below each
witness a property the slice's suites assert beside them.

Platform: Darwin arm64, Chez Scheme 10.4.1 (`tarm64osx`), libuv 1.52.1, 2026-10-03.
Library path as in M7
(`src:tests:vendor/chez-libuv/src:vendor/chez-httparse/src:vendor/chez-httparse/vendor/byte-machine/src:vendor/uriparse/src:build/scheme-libs:vendor/chez-httparse/test/support/harness:vendor/chez-libuv/tests`).
Each mutant ran from a scratch copy of the mutated file, placed first on the
library path under an absolute root, or, for a suite program, run from that
root; a process the suite starts, `tests/serve-child.sps`, inherits that path.
The substitution had to match exactly once, several edits to one file applied
in turn, and the tree was never edited. A row lists each suite that went red
and its failures; the others were green. "exit 2" is a suite whose body
raised.

## M8.1 — the drain (2026-10-03)

Built in one working tree on the owner's "start M8.1" (progress.md, M8.1),
reviewed on the owner's form, then cut into three stacked steps: the limit
and the core's rows (feat/m8.1-rows); the drain in the shell
(feat/m8.1-drain); the signals and `serve` (feat/m8.1-signals). Each run
took a set of mutants against every suite of its tree, a frozen copy of the
working tree's files, or of the step's own, main's with the step's files,
with vendor and build linked, four at a time. Every mutant in every run
loaded (no `Exception` in any report).

### The first step: the limit and the core's rows

Eighteen mutants on the step's own tree, after the review: each reddens a
check.

| Mutant | Step | Where | Change | Reddens (suite, failures) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M8C-0 | 1 | `connection` | the old row: idle drains, half-closing, and draining a state again | connection-table 3 |
| M8C-1 | 1 | `connection` | idle told to finish asks for nothing | connection-table 1 |
| M8C-2 | 1 | `connection` | a request in flight never marked to close | connection-table 8 |
| M8C-3 | 1 | `connection` | a reason of its own overwritten | connection-table 1 |
| M8C-4 | 1 | `connection` | lingering told to finish closes at once | connection-table 1 |
| M8C-5 | 1 | `connection` | idle closes as at its idle deadline | connection-table 1 |
| M8C-6 | 1 | `connection` | responding not told | connection-table 3 |
| M8C-7 | 1 | `connection` | the in-flight states refuse the event | connection-table 2 |
| M8C-8 | 1 | `connection` | closing told to finish closes again | connection-table 1 |
| M8C-9 | 1 | `connection` | a state in any phase accepted | connection-table 1 |
| M8C-10 | 1 | `connection` | a cancelled request logged as a read error, as before the review | connection-table 2 |
| M8L-1 | 1 | `limits` | default-limits' drain is 9 s | limits 2 |
| M8L-2 | 1 | `limits` | the environment's default drain is 9 s | limits 1 |
| M8L-3 | 1 | `limits` | the variable listed as CHEZ_HTTP_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS | limits 1 |
| M8L-4 | 1 | `limits` | the drain read in its stored unit, not seconds | limits 1 |
| M8L-5 | 1 | `limits` | the drain's accessor answers 10 s whatever the field holds | limits 2 |
| M8T-1 | 1 | `the table` | T11 loses its instances | connection-table 1 |
| M8T-2 | 1 | `the table` | D4 loses its instances | connection-table 1 |

The step adds or changes fourteen checks, each reddened by one of them: the
limits suite's value test (M8L-1) and override (M8L-4, M8L-5), its drift
guard (M8L-1, M8L-2), its variables (M8L-3) and `limits-with` (M8L-5); and
the table's states (M8C-0), T8's ten instances (idle by M8C-1, the six
in flight by M8C-2, a reason of its own by M8C-3, lingering by M8C-4,
closing by M8C-8), T10 and T11 (M8C-2), T12 (M8C-10), the held pairs
(M8C-0), the two counts (M8T-1, M8T-2), and the state outside the ten
(M8C-9).
